                <p style="color:black">There's nothing more important than our good health - that's our principal capital asset. Our greatest happiness does not depend on the condition of life in which chance has placed us, but is always the result of a good conscience, good health.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p style="color:black"> Fitness is like a relationship. You can’t cheat and expect it to work.
                    Our objective through this project is to create a fitness software for people so that they do not have to hit the gym everyday. This application includes all the workouts needed for the human body that can be done with or without fitness equipment , a diet plan so that people can stay fit physically. This application also includes yoga and meditation modules so that people can practice yogic poses and also meditate regularly for overall fitness of the body,since  we believe that a body has to be both physically and mentally fit. This software is the total package for ultimate fitness.
